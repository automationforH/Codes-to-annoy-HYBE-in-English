	var subject = "Urgent Matter: Demanding HYBE To Divest From Zionism, Zionist Collaborators & Companies and Remove Scooter Braun";
  var body = "Open Letter to HYBE <br><br><br> It has been over 110 days and 75 years since Israel has been oppressing, attacking, and murdering Palestinian civilians. Since October 7th, 2023, it is estimated that over 30,000 civilians in Gaza have been killed or trapped under rubble.[1] This slow genocide did not start last year, neither did the propaganda that dehumanizes Palestinians and their fight for equality and freedom.<br><br>We, as fans of the HYBE Family, are asking for HYBE to divest and disassociate from Zionist corporations, brands, and individuals as the recent escalation in Gaza has turned into a genocide. We ask HYBE, as ARMY, MOA, CARAT, ENGENE, FEARNOT, FLOVER, TOKKI, LUNÉ, ONEDOOR, to take a stand against the genocide and apartheid carried out by Israel and stand with the Palestinians. We ask that HYBE takes this stance by taking action to the immediate divestment from Zionists, which include: canceling collaborations with brands and individuals who support Zionist ideology, the removal of Scooter Braun from HYBE America, and the dissolvement of HYBE's joint venture partnership with Geffen Records. We understand that while some of these actions can be taken immediately, others may take longer time. However, it is still our right as consumers of HYBE Corp. to demand that the company takes action as soon as possible.<br><br> What We Ask Of HYBE: <br><br>1. We, as fans of HYBE, ask that HYBE take the initiative to thoroughly research and review any ongoing and future collaborations and divest from Zionist collaborators. This includes fellow musicians, producers, and dancers. <br><br>2. We ask that HYBE immediately cancels the RM X Pharrell collaboration, due to Pharrell's involvement in raising 60 Million USD for the Israeli Occupation Military, merely months after that same military were actively attacking and killing peaceful Palestinian protesters during the 2018 Great March of Return.[2] <br><br>3. We ask that HYBE cancels any future and ongoing brand deals/collaborations with McDonalds, Hyundai, Disney and other brands on the BDS List.[3] <br><br>4. We ask that HYBE severs its ties with Scooter Braun, who is currently the CEO of HYBE America. Since October 7th, 2023, Braun has been posting and repeating horrific genocidal propaganda that has further stigmatized and dehumanized Palestinians, such as Instagram Story posts that suggested the mass expulsion of indigenous Palestinians from their homeland (in this case Gaza) and taken as refugees across the region. Another Instagram Post shared in January 2024 is an interview Scooter has with Noa Tishby, an Israeli Zionist, where Braun claims that the music festival by the Gaza border was to show a desire for the Israelis to dance with the Palestinians. Do not mistake these words or posts online as Scooter caring for Palestinian lives, because if he did he would have called for a ceasefire in October. Instead of using his platform as a zionist propaganda page, he would acknowledge the thousands of Palestinian lives lost, adequately address people as civilians or military soldiers, and advocate for the betterment of Palestinians quality of life in Gaza and the West Bank. If Scooter Braun cared for Palestinian people, he would acknowledge Israel as a settler colonial entity, and advocate for Palestinian right of return. However, he has continuously proven to be Islamophobic and racist towards Palestinians through his social media platform, spreading a harmful narrative of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims to his millions of followers. <br><br>5. We ask that HYBE end its joint venture partnership with Geffen Records, and finds and/or creates an alternative label that does not have ties towards the Zionist ideology that advocates for the violent genocide of Palestinians. <u><br><br> What We Will Do To Get To Our Goal: <br><br></u>1. As fans of HYBE, we will be actively boycotting all content that is posted outside of Weverse and on platforms that have been placed on the BDS list, such as Disney+ collaborations. <br>2. As fans of HYBE, we will also be boycotting and canceling HYBE merchandise on Weverse until we not only have your attention but receive a response. <br>3. As fans of HYBE, we will trend hashtags and posts on Weverse, Twitter/X, Instagram, Tiktok, and other social media platforms. We will do so with a few hashtags, such as #HYBEDivestFromZionsim and #하이브시오니스트를제거하다. <br>4. As fans of HYBE, we will continue to advocate publicly for the justice of Palestinians, and our dissatisfaction with HYBE's ties to Zionism. As time goes on, we will get louder and reach different means of communicating our grievances. We ask that you listen to our demands earnestly. <br><br>We will continue to do these measures and increase these actions until we are heard and receive a response from HYBE highlighting the actions they will take to divest from Zionism. <br><br> HYBE has transformed themselves into being the strongest multinational entertainment company. They have done this not only through innovation and risk taking, but through sincerely listening to the demands of their consumers, who are fans of the talented artists they uplift. We hope that HYBE takes the right side of history this time around and divests from an ideology that is currently committing war crimes against indigenous Palestinians. <br><br>We will be anticipating an appropriate response from you. <br><br>Thank you,<br>"+name+"<br>";

# Updated Instructions for the Modified Letters

1. Go to Google Apps Script
2. Open the file where you wrote *"Letter 1"*
3. Paste the code, **"Modified Letter 1"** to the file in front of you.
   
4. You can keep/remove your email from the code (this is just for checking if the code works!)
  - If you get an email, everything's clear & you can update the recipient emails to the HYBE emails given by A4P.
    
5. Replace [YOUR NAME] with your name in the code
6. Click on Save.
7. Test the code by clicking on Run.

8. If you get an error message saying "Too many requests" or "Too many sent," DON'T WORRY.
    - The number of emails that have been sent from YOUR email address would have reached the daily limit.
    - Just open the saved code the next day and click on Run.
      
9. Repeat the same process for "Modified Letter 2" from [here](https://tinyurl.com/codes-to-annoy-HYBE)
    
10. Optional: (Only for those who want to try! Else you can stop at step 9)
    
  - For those who have a basic idea about coding, you can choose 3 different sets of subject lines for the letters.
  - Click on "Random Subjects Line" file given [here](https://tinyurl.com/codes-to-annoy-HYBE)
  - Pick a set each for both letters
  - Paste it right above the code line: **"var randomSubject = subjects[Math.floor(Math.random() * subjects.length)];"**
    - You will find this line in both "Modified Letter 1" and "Modified Letter 2"
  - Click on Save
  - Click on Run
    
11. To end the automatic emails, go back to Triggers, click the three dots on the right hand side, and click on Delete Trigger.

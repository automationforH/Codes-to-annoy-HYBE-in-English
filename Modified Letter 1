  var body = "Dear Big Hit Music & Hybe Labels,<br><br> As a fan of BTS, I am writing to express my immense disappointment, deep concerns and disgust regarding the people your company chooses to associate and work with. Especially Scott Samuel Scooter Braun, who has been misusing his influential social media platforms to spread violent Zionist propaganda, showing support for Islamophobia, the genocide of the Palestinian people, Nazism and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. Scooter has spent the last four months expressing genocidal rhetoric and showing his true colors as a Zionist Nazi. <br><br> The BTS ARMY community is a largely diverse community with strong principles and a passion for social justice and human rights, that is why it is deeply disappointing and unacceptable to see your company associate with individuals who endorse and promote colonization, genocide, ethnic cleansing and violations of many international war crimes at the hands of Israel's occupation. <br><br> I want to emphasize that my concerns are not just regarding my favorite artist's image or disagreement of opinions, but it is about the lasting negative effect the actions of Scooter and other Zionist collaborators will have on Palestine and the rest of the world. My consciousness and humanity do not allow me to consume media from a company that is responsible for such a negative impact and has blood on its hands. As fans we have always spoken out against injustice, so it is important that we stick to our principles and denounce Islamophobia, Zionist Nazism and racism and choose to support a company that is on the right side of history. Especially a company from South Korea, a country that has a history with similar experiences of colonization and oppression just like the Palestinians today. A people whose ancestors have been in the same position as the Palestinians are currently experiencing. A country that has also been greatly negatively affected by US military invasion and shares a vital year with the Palestinians; 1948. Those who have been oppressed in the past should stand with those who are oppressed today. <br><br>This issue exceeds the difference of opinion or freedom of speech, because these opinions cause irreversible damage, harm and literally contribute to the extinction of a whole nation. So it is our duty and responsibility to denounce them and stand for humanity. We have witnessed the genocide of the Palestinian people for 75 years and 4 months and seen them be colonised, displaced, their land stolen and their families brutally massacred. That's why as a fandom that passionately supports human rights, we also support the Palestinian freedom and right to resist and defend themselves against their oppressor. That is also why we are extremely outraged by your company's choice of collaborations with people who support literal Nazism and we strongly condemn association with any Zionist individuals or companies. In the last four months, 30000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli occupation, so silence at this stage is unacceptable. You are just as complicit.<br><br> HYBE is known as a company that is not afraid to take the lead and doesn't shy away from innovation, choosing revolutionary methods. It is known as the first company to give its artists freedom and full agency and to educate its idols on social issues around the globe. That is why it is important for you to spearhead this movement of dissociating and divesting from Zionist Nazism in the music industry and to be at the frontlines of solidarity with the Palestinian people. Be the change and innovation you claim to be. <br><br> We demand that: <br><br> 1. HYBE immediately removes Scooter Braun as CEO of HYBE America and any other figure associated with the company who expresses racist genocidal Zionist Nazi ideologies. <br><br> 2. HYBE doesn't involve any other artists and collaborators in future projects and cancels possible planned collaborations with people who express racist Nazi ideologies, such as Pharrell Williams, who has raised $60 million in funds for the genocidal Israeli Occupation Forces. <br><br> 3. HYBE and its artists don't collaborate with companies that support/fund/associate with the Israeli Occupation and its violence against the Palestinians. <br><br> 4. HYBE takes our concerns and displeasure with its association with the violent and racist ideology of Zionist Nazism seriously, distances itself of this inhumanly violent Nazi doctrine and from now on does proper and thorough research before its collaborations. <br><br> We hope that HYBE Corporation and Big Hit Music, as a globally influential company, chooses to respect human rights, chooses to be on the right side of history and takes proper measures to do so. We urge you to respect our values. <br><br> We will be anticipating an appropriate response from you. <br><br>Thank you,<br>"+name+"<br>";
